# Suave
Suave is the No.1 credit card design library providing users with the tools needed to customize and download aesthetically pleasurable credit cards designs. The main branch would serve as the deployment base for the entire project for Proj_team_121. However, the team will make use of feature branches to comply with standard development practices. Commits made to feature branches will be eventually merged to the main branch after code review and acceptance.
